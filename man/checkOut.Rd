\description{
This function searches for spatial outliers, i.e. records too
far away from species core distributions based
on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance}{Mahalanobis
distances}. Spatial outliers can indicate misidentifications or records
obtained from cultivated individuals.
}
\details{
The function searches for spatial outliers using two different
methods to detect outliers (Liu et al., 2018): the classic and the robust
squared Mahalanobis distances (see help of \code{mahalanobisDist()} for details).
They can be used separetely or combined (See Examples).

To detect outliers, we need thresholds to be applied to the values of
Mahalanobis distances obtained for each species (arguments \code{clas.cut} and
\code{rob.cut}). Ideally these thresholds should be species-specific, but this
is not always possible. Based on the empirical distribution of some
Atlantic Forest species with very different number of occurrences and
spatial distribution patterns, Lima et al. (2020) noted that occurrences
outside the species ranges often had classic and robust Mahalanobis
distances above 3 and 16 (used here as defaults). For cultivated species,
they used more restrictive thresholds of 2.5 and 12, respectively. They
also mentioned that these thresholds are very conservative (i.e. only more
extreme outliers are removed) and so some outliers may remain undetected.

The detection of outliers may depend on the amount of unique coordinates
available. Therefore, the detection of spatial outliers is safer for cases
where many unique coordinates are available. As a rule of thumb, ten
unique coordinates per taxa should avoid possible problems (undetected
true outliers or detection of false outliers). See Examples.

# few data and close coordinates (no outliers)
lon <- c(-42.2,-42.3,-42.4,-42.3,-42.3)
lat <- c(-44.3,-44.2,-44.2,-42.2,-42.2)
df <- data.frame(lon = lon, lat = lat)
checkOut(df, lon = "lon", lat = "lat", n.min = 4)
checkOut(df, lon = "lon", lat = "lat", clas.cut = NULL, n.min = 4)

# some data and one outlier
lon <- c(runif(5, -45, -41), -12.2)
lat <- c(runif(5, -45, -41), -18.2)
df <- data.frame(lon = lon, lat = lat)

checkOut(df, lon = "lon", lat = "lat")
checkOut(df, lon = "lon", lat = "lat", clas.cut = NULL)
