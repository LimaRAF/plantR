\description{
Maps used to perform the validation of the original geographical coordinates.
For each country, the map contains the lowest administrative level available
at \href{https://gadm.org}{GADM}. We considered an initial total of 51 countries
and dependent territories for Latin America, but since seven of them are
available only at the lowest administrative level (e.g. Aruba, Curacao), they
were not included in this map (total of 44 individual polygons). The Latin
American definition used here include all American territories but the United
States and Canada.

\details{
Locality names (e.g. country, state, county) were edited to match the
\strong{plantR} default gazetteer, using the same \strong{plantR} functions used for
locality editing (i.e. \code{fixLoc()}, \code{prepLoc()}).

For Brazil, we cross-checked and corrected about 400 issues in GADM (version
3.6) related to municipality names with typos, old toponyms, switched names
and even bad name assignment to polygons (e.g. Manaus assigned under another
municipality, Mau√©s). An internal list of those changes (\code{gadmCheck}) is
provided for reproducibility.

Finally, polygons were simplified (tolerance: 0.0001 decimal degrees) to make
maps smaller in size and thus less burdensome for the geographical validation
procedures.
