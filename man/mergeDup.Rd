\arguments{
\item{dups}{the input data frame.}

\item{dup.name}{character. The name of column in the input data frame with
the duplicate group ID. Default to the \strong{plantR} output 'dup.ID'.}

\item{prop.name}{character. The name of column in the input data frame with
the proportion of duplicates found within the group ID. Default to the
\strong{plantR} output 'dup.prop'.}

\item{prop}{numerical. The threshold value of proportion of duplicated values
retrieved (i.e. dup.prop) to enter the merging routine. Should be between
zero and one. Default to 0.75.}

\item{info2merge}{Vector. The groups of information (i.e. fields) to be
merged. Currently, only taxonomic ('tax'), geographic ('geo') and/or
locality ('loc') information can be merged. Default to merge all of them.}

\item{tax.names}{Vector. A named vector containing the names of columns in
the input data frame with the taxonomic information to be merged.}

\item{geo.names}{Vector. A named vector containing the names of columns in
the input data frame with the geographical information to be merged.}

\item{loc.names}{Vector. A named vector containing the names of columns in
the input data frame with the locality information to be merged.}

\item{tax.level}{character. A vector with the confidence level of the
identification that should be considered in the merge of taxonomic
information. Default to "high".}

\item{overwrite}{logical. Should the merged information be overwritten or
stored in separate, new columns. Default to FALSE (new columns are
created).}
}
\value{
If \code{overwrite == FALSE}, the function returns the input data frame
\code{dups} and the new columns containing the homogeneized information. The
names of these columns are the same of the previous one but with an added
suffix '1'. If \code{overwrite == TRUE}, the homogeneized information is saved
on the same columns of the input data and the names of the columns remain
the same.
}
\description{
This function homogenize the information of different groups of
fields (e.g. taxonomic, geographic or locality) for groups of duplicate specimens.
}
\details{
The homogenization of the information within groups of duplicates depends
on the existence of some fields in the input data frame, which result from
the \strong{plantR} workflow. The first essential field is the duplicate group
identifiers, which is used to aggregate the records (see functions
\code{prepDup()} and \code{getDup()}). The name of the column with these identifiers
must be provided to the argument \code{dup.name} (default to 'dup.ID'). Other
essential fields depend on the type of merge desired (argument
\code{info2merge}), a different set of columns names are needed. These names
should be provided to the arguments \code{tax.names}, \code{geo.names}, and \code{loc.names}.

For the merge of taxonomical information, the fields required by
\code{tax.names} are:
\itemize{
\item 'family': the botanical family (default: 'family.new')
\item 'species': the scientific name (default: 'scientificName.new')
\item 'det.name': the indentifier name (default: 'identifiedBy.new')
\item 'det.year': the identification year (default: 'yearIdentified.new')
\item 'tax.check': the confidence level of the taxonomic identification (default: 'tax.check')
}

For the merge of geographical information, the fields required by
\code{geo.names} are:
\itemize{
\item 'lat': latitude in decimal degrees (default: 'decimalLatitude.new')
\item 'lon': longitude in decimal degrees (default: 'decimalLongitude.new')
\item 'org.coord': the origin of the coordinates (default: 'origin.coord')
\item 'prec.coord': the precision of the coordinates (default: 'precision.coord')
\item 'geo.check': the result of the geo. coordinate validation (default: 'geo.check')
}

For the merge of locality information, the fields required by \code{loc.names}
are:
\itemize{
\item 'loc.str': the locality search string (default: 'loc.correct')
\item 'res.gazet': the resolution of the gazetteer coordinates (default: 'resolution.gazetteer')
\item 'res.orig': the resolution of the source coordinates (default: 'resol.orig')
\item 'loc.check': the result of the locality validation (default: 'loc.check')
}

For all groups of information (i.e. taxonomic, geographic and locality), the
merging process consists in ordering the the information available for each
group of duplicates from the best to the worst quality/resolution available.
The best information available is then expanded for all records of the group
of duplicates. The argument \code{prop} defines the duplicated proportion (given
by \code{prop.name}) that should be used as a threshold. Only records with
duplicated proportions above this threshold will be merged. For all other
records, the output will be the same as the input. If no column \code{prop.name} is
found in the input data, merge is performed for all records, with a warning.

For the merge of taxonomical information, the specimen(s) with the highest
confidence level of the identification is used as the standard, from
which the taxonomic information is expanded to other specimens within the
same group of duplicates. By default, \code{mergeDup()} uses specimens flagged as
having a 'high' confidence level.

In the case of conflicting species identification among specialists for the
same group of duplicates, the most recent identification is assumed as the
most up-to-date one. Note that if the year of identification is missing from
one or more records, the corresponding identifications of these records are not
taken into account while trying to assign the most up-to-date identification
for a group of duplicates.

For the merge of geographical information, specimens are ordered according
to the result of their geographical validation (i.e. field 'geo.check') and
the resolutions of the original geographical coordinates. Thus, for each
group of duplicates the specimen whose coordinates were validated at the
best level (e.g. 'ok_county') is used to expand the information for the
specimens validate at lower levels (e.g. state or country levels).

A similar procedure is performed to expand the information regarding the
locality description. Specimens are ordered according to the result of their
locality validation (i.e. field 'loc.check'), and the one ranked best
within the group of duplicates (e.g. 'ok_municip.2locality') is the one used
as the standard.

The merge of collector information (i.e. collector name, number and year) are
predicted, but not yet implemented in the current version.
