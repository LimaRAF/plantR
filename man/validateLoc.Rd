\title{Validate Record Locality Information}
\usage{
validateLoc(x, res.orig = "resol.orig", res.gazet = "resolution.gazetteer")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame containing the resolution of the original and the
gazetteer locality information.resolution from the gazetteer.}

\item{res.orig}{character. The name of the column containing the resolution
of the locality information from the original records. Default to
'resol.orig'.}

\item{res.gazet}{character. The name of the column containing the resolution
of the locality information from which the gazetteer coordinates were
obtained. Default to 'resolution.gazetteer'.}
}
\value{
the data frame \code{x} with a new column 'loc.check' with the result
of the locality validation.
}
\description{
Compares the resolution of the locality information provided in
the original record with the resolution retrieved from the gazetteer.
}
\details{
The function simply compares if the original information provided
with each specimen is found in the locality gazetteer and at which resolution
(i.e. country, state, municipality). This comparison is strongly dependent on
the completeness of the gazetteer used. Please remind that the gazetteer
provided with \strong{plantR} is strongly biased towards Latin America, particularly
Brazil.

The records whose locality was not found in the gazetteer at the same
resolution are flagged with a "check_...". For these records, the
locality resolution is downgraded until a locality is found in the gazetteer.
If even the country name is not found, then the locality is flagged
as "no_info". Specimens retaining their resolution are flagged with a
"ok_same_resolution" and those found at a better resolution are flagged with an
"ok_" (e.g. 'ok_state2municipality': a record which had its original
resolution at the ' 'stateProvince' level is now at the 'municipality' level).

The records flagged with the class "check_local.2municip." should not be seen as
problematic, since the \strong{plantR} gazetteer contain a list of county names
that is much more comprehensive than the list of locality names.
