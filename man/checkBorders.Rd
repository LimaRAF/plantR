\usage{
checkBorders(
  x,
  geo.check = "geo.check",
  country.shape = "NAME_0",
  country.gazetteer = "loc.correct",
  output = "new.col"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame with the results from the coordinate validation}

\item{geo.check}{Name of the column with the validation of the coordinates
against country maps. Default to 'geo.check'}

\item{country.shape}{Name of the column with the country name obtained from the
world map based on the original record coordinates. Default to 'NAME_0'}

\item{country.gazetteer}{Name of the column with the country name obtained from
the gazetteer, based on the description of the record locality. Default to
'loc.correct'}

\item{output}{a character string with the type of output desired: 'new.col'
(new column with the result is added to the input data) or 'same.col'
(results overwritten into column \code{geo.check}).}
}
\value{
if \code{output} is 'new.col', a new column named 'border.check' is added
to the data, containing a TRUE/FALSE vector in which TRUE means countries
which share border and FALSE means countries that do not share borders
(country mismatch is not due to coordinates close to country borders). If
\code{output} is 'same.col', the column defined by \code{geo.check} is updated with a
suffix 'borders' or 'inverted' added to the validation class inside brackets.
}
\description{
For those records without a match between the country described
in the record and the country obtained from the geographical coordinates,
the function flags if the two countries share borders. These may be useful to
identify coordinates that are not problematic but that fall in another
country due to rounding or precision of coordinates or to cases when the
collector was not aware that a coutry border was crossed before obtaining
the coordinate.
