\title{Check Coordinates Near Shores}
\usage{
checkShore(
  x,
  geo.check = "geo.check",
  lat = "decimalLatitude.new",
  lon = "decimalLongitude.new",
  type = "buffer",
  dist.max = 50,
  output = "new.col"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame with the species records}

\item{geo.check}{character. Column with the result from the coordinate
checking. Defaults to 'geo.check'}

\item{lat}{character. Column with the corrected latitude to be checked.
Defaults to 'decimalLatitude.new'}

\item{lon}{character. Column with the corrected longitude to be checked.
Defaults to 'decimalLongitude.new'}

\item{type}{character. Type of approach to be used to flag records near the
shore (see Details). Default to "buffer".}

\item{dist.max}{numerical. Maximum distance (in kilometers) to detect records
near to the shore. Default to 50 km.}

\item{output}{a character string with the type of output desired: 'new.col'
(new column with the result is added to the input data) or 'same.col'
(results overwritten into column \code{geo.check}).}
}
\value{
if \code{output} is 'new.col', a new column named 'shore.check' is added
to the data, containing a TRUE/FALSE vector in which TRUE means coordinates
close to the shore and FALSE means coordinate in open sea. If \code{output} is
'same.col', the column defined by \code{geo.check} is updated with a the
previous class 'sea' is updated to 'shore' (records near the shore) and
'open_sea' (records far from the shore)
}
\description{
Checks records whose coordinates fall in the sea, but close to
the shoreline using different approaches.
}
\details{
Only coordinates flagged as 'sea' by the function \code{checkCoord()} are included
in the verification. For all other coordinates, the function returns NA.

Two approaches can be used to detect coordinates in the sea but near to the
shore, which are controlled by the argument \code{type}. The first one uses a 0.5
degree (~ 55 km in the Equator) buffer around the world map (\code{type} =
'buffer'). The second approach calculates the distance between the shore and
the record (\code{type} = 'buffer'), in which the user can provide a maximum
distance from the shore. This second approach, however, is much slower. For
the record, rounding or imprecision of coordinates at the degree and minute
levels can generate distance up to 130-157 km and 2.2-2.6 km, respectively,
depending on the latitude considered.
