\arguments{
\item{splink_data}{A data frame as in the output from \code{rspeciesLink()}}

\item{gbif_data}{A data frame as in the output from \code{rgbif()} or \code{rgbif2()}}

\item{user_data}{A data frame provided by the user. Minimum fields are: \code{c("collectionCode", "catalogNumber", "recordNumber", "recordedBy", "year", "country", "stateProvince", "county", "municipality", "decimalLatitude", "decimalLongitude", "identifiedBy", "dateIdentified", "typeStatus", "scientificName", "scientificNameAuthorship", "institutionCode")}. Fields can be placed at any order and any given name. If using \code{user_data} argument, the user must indicate the name of the column for each field if not already in DwC standard}

\item{bind_data}{Logical. Either to bind data from differents sources after formatting}

\item{drop}{Logical. Either to drop fields unused by the data cleaning routine performed by plantR}

\item{collectionCode}{The name of the column containing the name, acronym, coden, or initialism identifying the collection or data set from which the record was derived}

\item{catalogNumber}{The name of the column containing an identifier for the record within the data set or collection}

\item{recordNumber}{The name of the column containing an identifier given to the Occurrence at the time it was recorded. Often serves as a link between field notes and an Occurrence record, such as a specimen collector's number}

\item{recordedBy}{The name of the column containing a person, group, or organization responsible for recording the original Occurrence}

\item{year}{The name of the column containing the four-digit year in which the Event occurred, according to the Common Era Calendar}

\item{country}{The name of the column containing the name of the country or major administrative unit in which the Location occurs}

\item{stateProvince}{The name of the column containing the name of the next smaller administrative region than country (state, province, canton, department, region, etc.) in which the Location occurs}

\item{county}{The name of the column containing the full, unabbreviated name of the next smaller administrative region than stateProvince (county, shire, department, etc.) in which the Location occurs}

\item{municipality}{The name of the column containing the full, unabbreviated name of the next smaller administrative region than county (city, municipality, etc.) in which the Location occurs. Do not use this term for a nearby named place that does not contain the actual location}

\item{decimalLatitude}{The name of the column containing the geographic latitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie between -90 and 90, inclusive}

\item{decimalLongitude}{The name of the column containing the geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive}

\item{identifiedBy}{The name of the column containing alist (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations who assigned the Taxon to the subject}

\item{dateIdentified}{The name of the column containing the date on which the subject was identified as representing the Taxon}

\item{typeStatus}{The name of the column containing a nomenclatural type (type status, typified scientific name, publication) applied to the subject}

\item{scientificName}{The name of the column containing the full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known. When forming part of an Identification, this should be the name in lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined. This term should not contain identification qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the IdentificationQualifier term}

\item{scientificNameAuthorship}{The name of the column containing the authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode}

\item{institutionCode}{The name of the column containing The name (or acronym) in use by the institution having custody of the object(s) or information referred to in the record}
}
\value{
Either a data.frame or list with the database fields formatted following DarwinCore standards
}
\description{
Formats fields in the occurrence data frame -either downloaded from a database or provided by the user- according to the DarwinCore standard. Optionally, drops fields not used in data cleaning performed by plantR. In addition, this functions can bind different sources of data after formatting.
