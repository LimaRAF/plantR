\arguments{
\item{splink_data}{A data frame as in the output from \code{rspeciesLink()}}

\item{gbif_data}{A data frame as in the output from \code{rgbif()} or \code{rgbif2()}}

\item{bien_data}{A data frame as in the output from the
\code{BIEN_occurrence}-function family}

\item{user_data}{A data frame provided by the user. Minimum fields are:
\code{c("collectionCode", "catalogNumber", "recordNumber", "recordedBy", "year", "country", "stateProvince", "county", "municipality", "decimalLatitude", "decimalLongitude", "identifiedBy", "dateIdentified", "typeStatus", "scientificName", "scientificNameAuthorship", "institutionCode")}. Fields can
be placed at any order and any given name. If using \code{user_data} argument,
the user must indicate the name of the column for each field if not already
in DwC standard}

\item{bind_data}{Logical. Either to bind data from different sources after
formatting}

\item{drop}{Logical. Either to drop non-essential fields to the data cleaning
routine performed by plantR}

\item{drop.opt}{Logical. Either to drop optional fields in the data cleaning
routine performed by plantR}

\item{drop.empty}{Logical. Either to drop fields where all values are NA}

\item{fix.encoding}{Character. The name of the input data frame (i.e.
'splink_data', 'gbif_data', 'bien_data', 'user_data') that common encoding
problems from text in 'latin1' should be re-encoded to UTF-8. Default to
NULL (no re-encoding is performed)}

\item{institutionCode}{The name of the column containing The name (or
acronym) in use by the institution having custody of the object(s) or
information referred to in the record}

\item{collectionCode}{The name of the column containing the name, acronym,
coden, or initialism identifying the collection or data set from which the
record was derived}

\item{catalogNumber}{The name of the column containing an identifier for the
record within the data set or collection}

\item{recordNumber}{The name of the column containing an identifier given to
the Occurrence at the time it was recorded. Often serves as a link between
field notes and an Occurrence record, such as a specimen collector's number}

\item{recordedBy}{The name of the column containing a person, group, or
organization responsible for recording the original Occurrence}

\item{year}{The name of the column containing the four-digit year in which
the Event occurred, according to the Common Era Calendar}

\item{country}{The name of the column containing the name of the country or
major administrative unit in which the Location occurs}

\item{stateProvince}{The name of the column containing the name of the next
smaller administrative region than country (state, province, canton,
department, region, etc.) in which the Location occurs}

\item{county}{The name of the column containing the full, unabbreviated name
of the next smaller administrative region than stateProvince (county,
shire, department, etc.) in which the Location occurs}

\item{municipality}{The name of the column containing the full, unabbreviated
name of the next smaller administrative region than county (city,
municipality, etc.) in which the Location occurs. Do not use this term for
a nearby named place that does not contain the actual location}

\item{locality}{The name of the column containing the specific description of
the place in which the Location occurs.}

\item{decimalLatitude}{The name of the column containing the geographic
latitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in
geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are
north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie
between -90 and 90, inclusive}

\item{decimalLongitude}{The name of the column containing the geographic
longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in
geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are
east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal
values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive}

\item{identifiedBy}{The name of the column containing a list (concatenated
and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations who assigned
the Taxon to the subject}

\item{dateIdentified}{The name of the column containing the date on which the
subject was identified as representing the Taxon}

\item{typeStatus}{The name of the column containing a nomenclatural type
(type status, typified scientific name, publication) applied to the subject}

\item{family}{The name of the column containing the family in which the taxon
is classified.}

\item{scientificName}{The name of the column containing the full scientific
name, with authorship and date information if known. When forming part of
an Identification, this should be the name in lowest level taxonomic rank
that can be determined. This term should not contain identification
qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the
IdentificationQualifier term}

\item{scientificNameAuthorship}{The name of the column containing the
authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the
conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode}
}
\value{
Either a data.frame or list with the database fields formatted
following DarwinCore standards
}
\description{
Formats fields in the occurrence data frame - either downloaded
from a database or provided by the user - according to the DarwinCore
standard. Optionally, drops fields not used in data cleaning performed by
plantR and do some text re-encoding. In addition, this functions can bind
different sources of data after formatting.
