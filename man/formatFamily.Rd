\details{
First search of names is based on the list of families and accepted synonyms
for vascular plants obtained from the APG website
(\href{http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/}), which includes families
cited in the APG IV (2016) and in the PPG I (2016). If the family name is not
found in the APG list, a search is carried in the Brazilian Flora 2020
(BF-2020), using package `flora`. If the family name is still not found in
BF-2020, then a final try is performed in The Plant List (TPL), using package
`Taxonstand`. Family names retrieved from BF-2020 and TPL are finally
converted to the names accepted by the APG IV or PPG I.

In case there is a conflict in the original family name and the name found
based on the genus name, the original name is replaced by the name from the
APG IV or PPG I with a warning.
