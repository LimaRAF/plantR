\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame containing the names of the vascular plant families and
the corresponding species.}

\item{fam.name}{character. The name of the column containing the family
names. Default to "family".}

\item{gen.name}{character. The name of the column containing the genus names.
Default to "genus"}

\item{spp.name}{character. The name of the column containing the species
names. Default to "scientificName"}

\value{
the data frame \code{x} with an additional column called
'family.new'.

\description{
Search for valid family names of vascular plants following the
APG IV (2016) and in the PPG I (2016).
}
\details{
The data frame \code{x} must contain at least two columns which stores the
family and species names. By default, the names of these columns should be
\code{family} and \code{speciesName}, following Darwin Core field names. Optionally,
a column with the genus name can be provided (default column name: 'genus').
If it is not provided, this columns is generated internally based on the
species names provided.

The first search of names is based on the list of families and accepted
synonyms for vascular plants provided by \strong{plantR}, which was mainly
compiled from the \href{http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/}{APG
website}, which includes families cited in the APG IV (2016) and in the PPG I
(2016).

If the family name is not found in this list, a second search is carried in
the Brazilian Flora 2020 (BF-2020), using package \code{flora} (Carvalho 2019). If
the family name is still not found in BF-2020, then a final try is performed
in The Plant List (TPL), using package \code{Taxonstand} (Cayuela et al. 2017).
Family names retrieved from BF-2020 and TPL are finally converted to the
names accepted by the APG IV or PPG I.

In case there is a conflict in the original family name and the name found
based on the genus name, the original name is replaced by the name from the
APG IV or PPG I with a warning.
