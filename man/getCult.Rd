\title{Flag Occurrences From Cultivated Individuals}
\usage{
getCult(
  x,
  remarks = "occurrenceRemarks",
  loc.name = "locality",
  habitat = "habitat"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame with the species record data.}

\item{remarks}{character. The name of the column containing the record
remarks. Default to the Darwin Core standard 'occurrenceRemarks'.}

\item{loc.name}{character. The name of the column containing the record
locality information. Default to 'locality'.}

\item{habitat}{character. The name of the column containing the record
habitat information. Default to 'habitat'.}
}
\value{
The input data frame with an additional column 'cult.check'
with the result of the search for records from cultivated individuals.
}
\description{
This function detects records from cultivated individuals,
based on record locality, description and habitat.
}
\details{
The input data frame \code{x} should contain at least one of the
columns containing the description of the record locality (e.g.
'locality'), remarks (e.g. 'occurrenceRemarks'), or habitat. The names of
columns in which these information is stored can de declared using the
arguments \code{loc.name}, \code{remarks} and \code{habitat} (defaults to the Darwin Core
standard notation).

If present, other Darwin Core fields are used internally to obtain missing
information on the three fields declared above, namely: 'verbatimLocality',
'biologicalStatus' and 'fieldNotes'. Therefore, the search for cultivated
individuals in \strong{plantR} is NOT based on the geographical coordinates of
the species records, although records flagged as spatial outliers by
\strong{plantR} (see function \code{checkOut()}) may also be flagged as cultivated.

The search of records from cultivated individuals is performed on all the
fields available and it is based on a list of terms that denotes clear
indication of cultivated individuals (e.g. 'Cultivated', 'Planted',
'Exotic'). The function returns the column 'cult.check' with two
categories:
\itemize{
\item "cultivated": exact matches of the list of terms of cultivated
individuals with the text in at least one of the fields mentioned above.
\item "prob_cultivated": presence of one or more terms in the fields mentioned
above.
}

For assigning the "prob_cultivated", a second list of terms is used to
exclude possible spurious hits of cultivated individuals (e.g 'Cultivated
area' or 'Presence of exotic species'). But this list is not extensive and
so this category may need some level of double-checking by the user.
