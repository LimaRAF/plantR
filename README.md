An R Package for Managing Species Records from Biological Collections

### Description

The package plantR provides tools for downloading, processing, cleaning,
validating, summarizing and exporting records of species occurrences
from biological collections.

Please read the package
[Introduction](https://github.com/LimaRAF/plantR/blob/dev/vignettes/plantR.pdf)
and detailed
[Tutorial](https://github.com/LimaRAF/plantR/blob/dev/vignettes/articles/plantR_tutorial.pdf)
for more details.

#### Installation

The package can be installed in R from [github](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
library("remotes")
install_github("LimaRAF/plantR")
library("plantR")
```

You can also download the development (and probably most up-to-date)
version of the package with:

``` r
install_github("LimaRAF/plantR", ref = "dev")
library("plantR")
```

If you run into errors while installing the package, please check the
detailed package introduction for alternatives.

##### Bug report and suggestions

The plantR project is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LimaRAF/plantR/). Please report any bugs and
suggestions of improvements for the package
[here](https://github.com/LimaRAF/plantR/issues).

The package gazetteer and the list of taxonomists are constantly being
improved. If you want to contribute with regional gazetteers or with
missing names of taxonomists, please e-mail <raflima@usp.br>.

list of plant taxonomists used in the package, João Vieira for
suggestions of code fixes and updates, and André L. de Gasper and Leila
Meyer, for their valuable suggestions on how to make this package more
useful and flexible for collection managers, taxonomists and ecologists.
