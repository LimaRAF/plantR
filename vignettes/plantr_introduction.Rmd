# Introduction

The databases of biological collections are becoming increasingly available
online, providing an unprecedented amount of species records for biodiversity
studies. Managing the information associated with species records is an
important but difficult task. The notation of collectors' names, numbers and
dates vary between collections, and sometimes within them. In addition, it is
often difficult to validate the localities, geographical coordinates and
identifications associated with individual records, especially when working with thousands or millions of them. Thus, having tools to process and validate large amounts of species records can be quite handy.

__plantR__ is an R package that was developed to manage, standardize and
validate the information associated with species records from biological
collections (e.g. herbaria). It can be used for data coming from a single
collection or different biodiversity databases, such as
[GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/). Moreover, __plantR__ can be used by collection
curators to manage their databases and  by the final users of the occurrence
data (e.g. taxonomists, ecologists and conservationists), allowing the
comparison of data across collections.

## Main features and workflow

The package __plantR__ provides tools to standardize the information from typical fields of species occurrence records, such as collectors' and species names. In addition, __plantR__ proposes a comprehensive and reproducible workflow to apply those tools while handling data from biological collections, which includes the following steps:

1. the download of species occurrence records for a list of species names,
    collections codes or other search fields;

2. the batch standardization of typical fields (e.g. collector
    name);

3. the validation of the locality and geographical coordinates of the
    records, based on maps and gazetteers;
  
4. the spell-checking and validation of botanical families and species names
from different taxonomic backbones (e.g. Flora do Brasil);

5. the assessment of the confidence level of species identifications, based on a global list of plant taxonomists.
    
6. the retrieval of duplicated specimens across collections, including the 
    homogenization of the information within duplicates.

7. data and validation summaries and the (fast) export of occurrence data by 
    groups (e.g. families or countries).
    
## Basic assumptions and limitations

The tools provided by __plantR__ do not edit the columns with the original
information. All the outputs of each editing or validation step are stored in
new, separated columns added to the original data. This is important for the
collection curation process because it allows the comparison between the
original and edited information. However, it increases the number of
columns in the dataset, which may become a problem while managing and saving big datasets.

__plantR__ was initially developed to manage plant records from herbaria. Therefore, some of the tools offered by the package are exclusive to plants, particularly the checking of species names. However, some of its main features are expected to work for other groups of organisms as well, as long as the data structure is similar.

Currently, the download of records is available for the [Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/), and
[speciesLink](http://splink.cria.org.br/), but the user can also provide his
own dataset as an input. Future versions of the package may include the download from data stored in [JABOT](http://jabot.jbrj.gov.br//).

Name editing and standardization cover most of the typical variation in the notation of people's names, trying to provide standardized outputs in the TDWG format. The same applies to collection codes, collector numbers and dates. However, __plantR__ does not handle all possibilities of notation. So, some double-checking and corrections may be needed depending on the user's goals. 

Regarding the validation of geographical coordinates. In the case of invalid or missing coordinates, we assume that the locality information associated with the record (e.g. country, state, county) is correct (i.e. locality prevails over coordinates), and so working coordinates are taken from a gazetteer. It is important to note that if the locality information is indeed mistaken (eg. wrong county name), then even if the original coordinates are good, they will not be validated (record locality and coordinate locality don't match) and may be replaced by coordinates taken from the gazetteer.

Currently, geographical validation can be performed at the county level for Latin American countries and at the country level for the rest of the world. We provide a gazetteer to retrieve and check localities and geographical coordinates, which is currently biased towards Latin American countries, particularly Brazil. Therefore, the validation of geographical coordinates provided by other R packages (e.g. __CoordinateCleaner__) may be more appropriate for studies extending outside Latin America.

Taxonomical validation is performed based on (i) the correction of plant family and species names (i.e. synonyms, typos) and (ii) the confidence level on the species identification, based on a dictionary of plant taxonomist names from all over the world. For i, names are currently checked against the [Flora do Brasil project](http://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/listaBrasil/ConsultaPublicaUC/ConsultaPublicaUC.do) and [The Plant List](http://www.theplantlist.org/), using the R packages __flora__ and __Taxonstand__. Future versions may include comparisons against Tropicos and GBIF backbones.

During the assessment of the taxonomic confidence level of the identifications, we did not attempt to set priorities for different specialists within a given family. That is, all the specimens determined by the specialist within their family of expertise were taken as being validated. Although we recognize that there are specialists for genera within a family, the validation process is currently performed only at the family level. In the case of conflicting species identification among family specialists for duplicates across collections, we assume the most recent identification as being the valid one. 

__plantR__ provide tools for searching for duplicated specimens across herbaria. This search makes more sense when data from different collections are combined and it performs well using relatively large datasets (i.e. millions of records). However, the retrieval of duplicates greatly depends on the completeness of the input information, the notation standards and if __plantR__ is able to handle those differences in notation among collections. In addition, true duplicates may not be found due to typos and false duplicates may be returned if the duplicate search fields are too flexible.

# Using __plantR__


## Installation
The package can be installed and loaded from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("remotes")
install_github("LimaRAF/plantR")
library("plantR")
```

## Main features

### Data entry

Users can provide their own dataset or download data using one of __plantR__ download functions. They include the function `rspeciesLink()`:

```{r splink-download, eval = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
occs_splink <- rspeciesLink(species = "Euterpe edulis", 
                            save = FALSE)
```

This function can also be used to search fro records based on localities, collections, and other options (see ?rspeciesLink for details). 

__plantR__ also provide the function `rgbif2()`, which is a wrapper of the function `rgbif()` of the __rgbif__ package, with an standardized output:

```{r gbif-download, eval = FALSE}
occs_gbif <- rgbif2(species = "Euterpe edulis", 
                    save = FALSE)
```

```{r load-data, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
occs_splink <- read.csv("results/speciesLink.csv")
occs_gbif <- read.csv("results/gbif.csv")
```


### Data editing

#### Field names

It is important to make sure that the input field names follow the DarwinCore format. In __plantR__ this is performed using the function `formatDwc()`, which joins data from different sources (e.g. GBIF and speciesLink) and standardize their field names: 
<!-- Note that an additional column `data_source` is created.  -->

```{r bind-data, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink, 
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, 
                  bind_data = TRUE)
```


#### Collection codes, people names, collector number and dates

The names of the collections, collectors and identifiers, as well as the collection numbers and dates can be edited using the function `formatOcc()`:

```{r formatOcc, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- formatOcc(occs)
```

#### Locality information

The locality information associated with the occurrence data (e.g. country or city names) can be standardized using the function `formatLoc()`: 

```{r formatLoc, eval = TRUE}
occs <- formatLoc(occs)
```

#### Geographical coordinates

The geographical coordinates are prepared using function `formatCoord()`, which guarantees that they are in a good format for validation (i.e. decimal degrees) and get missing coordinates from a gazetteer based on the
locality information:

```{r formatCoord, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- formatCoord(occs)
```

#### Species and family names

In this example, although we have dowloaded data for a single species (i.e. *Euterpe edulis*), there are differences in the notation of botanical family and species names, some of them being synonyms. To obtain only valid names, we use the function `formatTax()`:

```{r formatTax, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- formatTax(occs)
```

### Data validation

#### Locality information

Once the new columns with the edited and standardized information are available, the occurrence data can be validated. The first validation step regards the locality information, which is done using the function `validateLoc()`: 

```{r validateLoc, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- validateLoc(occs)
```

#### Geographical coordinates

```{r validateCoord, eval = FALSE}
occs <- validateCoord(occs)
```

#### Species taxonomy and identification

The next validation step regards the confidence level in the species identification associated with the occurrence data, which is one of the main __plantR__ features and executed by function `validateTax()`:

```{r validateTax, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- validateTax(occs)
```

Note that the function returns up to 10 names of identificators not taken as specialists of the family. The argument `miss.taxonomist` can be used to include missing names of taxonomists (e.g. `miss.taxonomist = c("Arecaceae_Reis, A.")`)

#### Duplicate specimens

Another main feature of __plantR__ is the search for duplicated specimens across herbaria (i.e. same specimen with accession numbers in two or more collections). It uses different combinations of search strings and network analysis to find direct and indirect links between occurrences. Besides the search, the user can also homogenize information, such as species names or geographical coordinates, within groups of duplicates. This tool is performed using the function `validateDup()`:


```{r validateDup, eval = TRUE, include=TRUE, warning = FALSE} 
occs <- validateDup(occs,
                    info2merge = c("tax", "loc"),
                    tax.name = "scientificName.new")
```

### Data summary and export

Once the editing and validation steps are finished, __plantR__ provides tools for summarizing the occurrence data, using the function `summaryData()`. In this example, the taxonomical summary is quite uninformative, since we have only one species.  

```{r summaryData, eval = TRUE, include=TRUE, collapse= TRUE} 
summ <- summaryData(occs)
```

It also provides an overview of the validation results (function `summaryFlags()`):

```{r summaryFlags, eval = TRUE, include=TRUE, collapse= TRUE} 
flags <- summaryFlags(occs)
```

The package __plantR__ can also build species check-lists with vouchers using the function `checkList()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse= FALSE} 
checkList(occs, n.vouch = 3, type = "short")
```

Finally, __plantR__ exports data into a local folder, using function `saveData()`, which can be used to save compressed '.csv' files based on different grouping fields (e.g. botanical family, country, biological collection). The export is performed using function `fwrite()` from package __data.table__ which is quite fast even for large datasets.
