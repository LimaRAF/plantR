# Introduction

This tutorial provides the details and explanations on the functions related to
data download, editing and validation using the __plantR__ workflow. For each of
the steps of the workflow, we present the functionalities and their options in
more details so that user can better understand their goals and so adapted the
functionalities even outside the workflow proposed here.

<br/><br/>

# Intalling __plantR__

__plantR__ is currently only available remotely on [GitHub](https://github.com).
This means that you cannot use R base functions to install it (i.e.,
`install.packages()`). There are different ways to install packages in R from remote repositories and here we suggest using the package __remotes__. So, first of all, we need to be sure that this package is installed and loaded.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages(remotes)
library("remotes")
```

Then we can use __remotes__ function `install_github()` to install __plantR__
from GitHub. 

Like many other R packages, __plantR__ depends on other packages to perform some
tasks (i.e., dependencies), and these packages often depend on other packages
(i.e.m recursive dependencies). Therefore, to install __plantR__ you also need
to install these dependencies. R should automatically install the packages you
don't have (this may be a long list depending on which packages you have already
installed). It also will prompt at your screen a list of packages that have more
recent versions available for update. It is good to have the most up-to-date
versions of all packages, but this is not a necessity to install __plantR__
(i.e., you can select to update none of the packages).

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("LimaRAF/plantR")
library("plantR")
```

For windows users, you may get a warning while trying to install __plantR__,
related to the installation of Rtools. This is a software that needs to be
installed in your machine, so that R can build and install packages from their
source code on Windows. It became necessary after R version 4.0. So make sure we
have Rtools installed, restart your R session and try to install __plantR__
again. Check [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) on how
to install Rtools on Windows.

Some users may still get the error below: 

```{r, eval = F}
Error: package '[name of the package]' was installed before R 4.0.0: please re-install it
```

If this is your case, we suggest installing/updating each of these packages individually, until you finally manage to run __plantR__ installation without problems. You may need to restart your R session again to make sure that the 
all dependencies were installed correctly.

# Data entry

You can download species records directly from R, using the functions provided
by __plantR__ or by other R packages. For this tutorial, we are going to use the
__plantR__ function `rspeciesLink()` and `rgbif2()`, which downloads data from
[CRIA](http://www.cria.org.br/) (Centro de Referência em Informação Ambiental)
and for the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) (Global Biodiversity Information
Facility).

In addition, you can download a DarwinCore Archive (DwC-A) file from the
[GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) API or to load a DwC-A from a local directory
using the function `readData()`. DwC-A files obtained from GBIF are provided as
'.zip' files and they contain not only the species records, but also the
information on the citations and rights of the the database collections.

You can also use your own data, as long as the column names follow the
DarwinCore (DwC) standards. If they don't follow the DwC standards, users can
still standardize the notation of column names using the function `formatDwc()`. 
Besides the field name standardization, `formatDwc()` also binds together the
records coming from different sources (e.g., CRIA, GBIF, user-provided data).

## Downloading species records with __plantR__

In this tutorial, we will use species records for three Neotropical tree
species:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
spp <- c("Casearia sylvestris",
         "Euterpe edulis",
         "Trema micrantha")
```

After defining the species names, we proceed to the download of species records.
We will first download only herbarium specimens (i.e., vouchers) for the names
listed above, including their synonyms accepted in the List of Species of the
Brazilian Flora 2020 project. This may take a minute depending on your internet connection:


```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs_splink <- rspeciesLink(species =  spp,
                        Scope = "plants",
                        basisOfRecord = "PreservedSpecimen",
                        Synonyms = "flora2020")
```

The function `rspeciesLink()` allows a wide variety of ways on how to search for
species records. Searches can also be done by locality and collections, using
all the filters available in CRIA. Please check the help of the function for
more details on the arguments that can be used for this search.

We will download records for the same species from GBIF, using the function
`rgbif2()`. This function uses internally the function `occ_search()` from the 
package __rgbif__, which should be consulted for details on how searches can
be performed.


```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs_gbif <- rgbif2(species =  spp,
                    basisOfRecord = "PRESERVED_SPECIMEN",
                    remove_na = FALSE, n.records = 500000)
```

The occurrence data is now stored in the objects `occs_splink` and `occs_gbif`.
We can inspect how many occurrences were downloaded:

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
nrow(occs_splink)
nrow(occs_gbif)
```

## Preparing the input data: function `formatDwc()`

Before we start to process the species records, we need to combine our input
data from CRIA and GBIF and make sure that the input data has all the required
fields and that they are in the required format.

We use the function `formatDwc()` to bind data and set up the required and
optional fields and to drop fields without essential information for the data
processing and validation. We save the output of the function in an object with
a different name (i.e., `occs`).

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink,
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, drop = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
dim(occs)
```

<br/><br/>

# Data editing

## Standardizing collection codes, people names, collector number and dates

Particularly when working with data coming from multiple sources, it
is important to standardize the notation used by different collections and
sometimes by different collectors within the same collection.

### Collection codes

The first step is the standardization of the notation of collection codes, which
is stored in the field 'collectionCode'. For some reason, not all collections
store in this field their international collection codes (e.g., Index
Herbariorum) and sometimes these codes are stored differently across data
repositories. For the search of duplicate entries and the production of
checklists (see below) it is important to standardize the codes of collections.
In __plantR__ this is done using function `getCode`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- getCode(occs)
```

This function returns a new column ('collectionCode.new') which contains the
standardized collection codes found in a __plantR__ list of herbaria, xylaria
and other plant collections. It also returns the column 'collectionObs', which
is empty if the collection code was found. But it also provides details if the
code is in the (e.g., Index Herbariorum) and it flags the collection codes not
found, which probably represent collections other than herbaria, xylaria or
carpotheks.

### Names of collectors and determiners

There is a lot of variation in the notation of people's names both within and
across biological collections. __plantR__ offers different tools to edited and
standardize those names. Several functions perform different operations, such
as standardizing the separation between multiple people's names,
the generational suffixes and the removal of Latin characters (function
`fixName()`). It also standardizes the format of name notation (i.e., Last Name,
First Name(s) or First Name(s), Last Name) and the abbreviation of name
initials (functions `prepTDWG()`, `getPrep()` and `getInit()`). These and other
functionalities are included in the function `prepName()`, which also performs
the removal of treatment prepositions (e.g., Dr., Profa.) and the separation
between the first collector/determiner from other collectors/determiners
(co-authors or auxiliary names), if present.

We will first standardize the names of collectors, which are stored
in the field 'recordedBy':
```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$recordedBy.new <- prepName(occs$recordedBy,
                               output = "first",
                               sep.out = "; ")
occs$recordedBy.aux <- prepName(occs$recordedBy,
                               output = "aux",
                               sep.out = "; ")
```

Note that we separated the first and auxiliary names for multiple people's
names. To do so, we set the argument `output` of function `prepName()` to
"first" and "aux" (by default `prepName()` edits and returns all people's
names).

We also define that the symbol that will separate multiple people's names, which
in our example will be a semi-colon followed by a space (argument `sep.out`). 

By default, the function removes accents and special characters from names, but
this can be controlled using the argument `special.char`. Also, the default name
format is 'last_init' (i.e., Last Name, First Names) which is controlled by the
argument `format`.

Next, we will do the same operation for the names of determiners, which are
stored in the field 'identifiedBy':
```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$identifiedBy.new <- prepName(occs$identifiedBy,
                               output = "first",
                               sep.out = "; ")
occs$identifiedBy.aux <- prepName(occs$identifiedBy,
                               output = "aux",
                               sep.out = "; ")
```

The function `prepName()` standardizes the most common types of name notation,
but not all of them. We recommend the user to look at the help of functions
`fixName()`, `prepTDWG()` and `prepName()` for examples of formats that these
functions cannot handle. However, this standardization will be useful for the
search of duplicated records across collections (see below).

We also recommend the user to look at all the options of output, which may
include accents (e.g., 'Araújo, J.' instead of 'Araujo, J.'), name prepositions
(e.g., 'de Araujo, J.' or ' Araujo, J. de'), abbreviations (e.g., 'Araujo,
Jose') or  different name formats (e.g., 'J. Araujo').

It is also useful for the validation process to standardize the notation for
missing collector and determiner names. To do so, we use the function
`missName()` and we set missing names to "s.n.".

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$recordedBy.new <- missName(occs$recordedBy.new, 
                                type = "collector", noName = "s.n.")
occs$identifiedBy.new <- missName(occs$identifiedBy.new, 
                                  type = "identificator", noName = "s.n.")
```

For some of the validation steps we will perform, it is also useful to extract
the last name of the first collector from the formatted field `recordedBy.new`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$last.name <- lastName(occs$recordedBy.new)
```


### Collector number

Species records are often associated with a number from a series of collections
of a given collector, which is stored in the field 'recordNumber'. One would
expect that this field would only contain numbers but this is not always the
case. In addition, collectors may add modifiers to their collection numbers,
such as '17-A' and '17-B'. 

Therefore, the notation of this field also needs standardization, which in
__plantR__ is performed using the function `colNumber()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$recordNumber.new <- colNumber(occs$recordNumber, noNumb = "s.n.")
```

### Collection and identification year

Similar to the collector number, the collection and identification years can
have other information than the year itself (i.e. months). To make sure that
these fields contain only years, we use the function `getYear()`. We set the
character that will represent records without the year of collection and
identification ("n.d.") using the argument `noYear`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$year.new <- getYear(occs$year, noYear = "n.d.")
occs$yearIdentified.new <- getYear(occs$dateIdentified, noYear = "n.d.")
```

The year of collection is sometimes stored on the field 'eventDate' and not on
the field 'year'. In this case, one should replace all missing information from
the field 'year' with the information stored in the field 'eventDate'.


### The wrapper function `formatOcc()`

All the previous steps are important to understand the editing process of each
field. __plantR__ can execute all these steps at once using the wrapper function
`formatOcc()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs1 <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink,
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, drop = TRUE)
occs1 <- formatOcc(occs1)
```

This wrapper will add the new columns containing the edited/formatted
information regarding the collection codes, the names of collector and
determiners, the dates of collection and identification, and collector number.


## Editing locality information

One type of information associated with species records is the collection
locality, namely "country", "stateProvince", "municipality" and "locality". 
__plantR__ provide tools to edit and validate this type of information, which
also is an important step to find missing geographical coordinates and to
validate the original coordinates provided with the records.

### Formatting locality information

__plantR__ has a function to edit and standardize locality fields: function
`fixLoc()`. By default, this function formats all four locality fields
simultaneously and returns the input data frame with the new locality columns.
But the user can choose to edit one field at a time by changing the function
argument 'admin.levels' (in this case, the function returns a vector). However,
some of the editing processes become more complete if all the information is
available for the four fields.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- fixLoc(occs,
               loc.levels = c("country","stateProvince","municipality","locality"),
               scrap = TRUE)
```

Note that we performed the editing of the locality fields using the argument
`scrap = TRUE`. This argument controls the search for missing information from
the field 'locality' (i.e., text mining). It also performs some extra editing
and cropping of the locality field to obtain more standardized locality
descriptions. If the country, state, and municipality fields are given, they
remain unaltered. Only missing information in these fields is completed by the
editing and scrapping process.

Although the search for missing localities generally results in empty fields
(i.e., NAs), it does not mean that the information retrieved from this search is
accurate. It depends on whether the information is actually available in the
field 'locality' and how it is arranged.


### Crossing the locality information with the gazetteer

To make sure that the original locality information and the missing information
obtained from function `fixLoc()` are valid localities, we need to crosscheck it
with a gazetteer. In __plantR__, the search for missing information from a
gazetteer is based on a standard locality string. This string simply is the
concatenation of the country, state, municipality and locality fields, at the
best resolution available. This string is created using the function `strLoc()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
locs <- strLoc(occs)
```

If the municipality exists for a given state and country, then it is deemed as
being a valid locality name, and the locality string associated with it is given
priority for the validation of the locality information (see below). If there is
missing information, then the alternative locality string (obtained using
argument `scrap` of function `fixLoc()`) is used as a final attempt to search
for missing information in the gazetteer. If both these alternatives do not
work, then the upper administrative level available is used as the reference
locality information.

The notation of locality information varies a lot, and there are many mistakes
regarding the notation of some localities (e.g., "Balneário do Camboriú" instead
of "Balneário Camboriú"). Therefore, it is useful to further simplify the
locality strings, by reducing all name variants into the same locality string.
This simplification is performed by the function `prepLoc()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
locs$loc.string  <- prepLoc(locs$loc.string) # priority string
locs$loc.string1 <- prepLoc(locs$loc.string1) # alternative string
locs$loc.string2 <- prepLoc(locs$loc.string2) # alternative string
```

After the construction and simplification of the locality search strings, we can
finally cross it with the gazetteer, using function `getLoc()`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
locs <- getLoc(locs, gazet = "plantR")
```

Some of the locality strings were retrieved in the default __plantR__ gazetteer
at the locality level (e.g., park, farm). The gazetteer is more complete for
Latin America and it currently has information at the locality level mostly for
Brazil. Therefore, info retrieval at the locality level should be biased towards
specimens collected in Brazil. You can use the argument `gazet` to use your
personal gazetteer instead of __plantR__ default, as long as it contains the
same fields (see the help of function `getLoc()` for more details).

Note that the function also returns the geographical coordinates from the
gazetteer, if the locality information was found. Note as well that the edited
version of the localities is different from the original localities regarding
their resolution (see details in the next section, 'Data validation'). <!-- ö
add link to section-->

We then merge the new output of the locality data processing with the main data
frame:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- cbind.data.frame(occs, locs[, c("loc","loc.correct","latitude.gazetteer","longitude.gazetteer","resolution.gazetteer")])
```
### The wrapper function `formatLoc()`

As before, we provide a function to execute the previous steps at once:

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs1 <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink,
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, drop = TRUE)
occs1 <- formatLoc(occs1)
```

### Getting correct locality names

It may be useful to trace back the full and valid names of the localities
retrieved from the gazetteer. This can be performed using the function
`getAdmin()`, which makes the query based on the locality search string
retrieved in the gazetteer:


```{r, eval = TRUE}
head(getAdmin(occs))
```


## Editing geographical coordinates

Previous to the validation of the original geographical coordinates, it is
important to make sure that they are provided in the required format: non-zero,
non-NA [decimal degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees), with
decimal digits separated by points.

### Preparing geographical coordinates

Function `prepCoord()` transforms the coordinates into decimal degrees and add
the columns "decimalLatitude.new" and "decimalLongitude.new", which store the
edited coordinates.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- prepCoord(occs)
```

### Obtaining coordinates from the gazetteer

Geographical coordinates are often missing or are provided in a format that the
function `prepCoord()` cannot convert to decimal degrees. For the dataset we are
using in this tutorial, we can inspect the proportion of occurrences without
geographical coordinates:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
table(!is.na(occs$decimalLatitude.new))/dim(occs)[1]
```

As we can see, ca. 20% of the occurrences records have no coordinates.
Therefore, one may want to use the coordinates obtained from the gazetteer to
replace the missing coordinates. In __plantR__ we use the function `getCoord()`
to do this procedure. This function also flags the origin and the probable
precision of the original coordinates:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- getCoord(occs)
table(!is.na(occs$decimalLatitude.new))/dim(occs)[1]
```

Now, missing coordinates were obtained from a gazetteer and there is a
coordinate at the best resolution available for almost all occurrences.

### The wrapper function `formatCoord()`

Similarly to the functions `formatOcc()` and `formatLoc()` from the previous
editing steps, we provide a function that perform all the edits related to the
geographical coordinates at once, the function `formatCoord()`. Because getting
missing coordinates from the gazetteer depends on the editing of the locality
information, we need to run `formatLoc()` before runnig `formatCoord()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs1 <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink,
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, drop = TRUE)
occs1 <- formatLoc(occs1)
occs1 <- formatCoord(occs1)
```

## Editing species taxonomic information

### Editing species names

Although we downloaded occurrences for only three species names, the function
`rspeciesLink()` returned (as required) all synonyms accepted by the Brazilian
Flora 2020 (\url{http://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/listaBrasil}). In
addition, the speciesLink network (\url{http://splink.cria.org.br/}) stores the
information as provided by the collections, which may vary in the way the
scientific names are stored. For data downloaded only from GBIF
(\url{https://www.gbif.org/}) this step may be unnecessary since GBIF already
stores data in a more standardized way.

The __plantR__ function `fixSpecies()` performs several edits, including the
isolation of taxonomic rank abbreviations, the detection of name modificators
("cf." and "aff.") and a suggestion for the name status:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- fixSpecies(occs)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sort(table(occs$scientificName))
sort(table(occs$scientificName.new))
```

Note that the number of names has decreased, but there are still many different
names than the three names used in the search. The possible status of those
names are stored in the new column 'scientificNameStatus'.

```{r, eval = TRUE}	
sort(table(occs$scientificNameStatus))
```

### Species synonyms and spelling

Although the function `fixSpecies()` presented above formatted the species
names, there are still many more names than the ones we downloaded. Most of them
are names at the infra-specific level, but others are probably synonyms,

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
listed in the Brazilian Flora 2020, there is also the package `flora`, which
follow the accepted nomenclature of the Brazilian Flora 2020 project. __plantR__
uses the functionalities of some of these packages to inspect possible
suggestions for species names, through the function `prepSpecies()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- prepSpecies(occs, db = c("bfo", "tpl"), sug.dist = 0.85)
table(occs$suggestedName)
table(occs$tax.notes)
```

The final output of the function provides the valid names for the names that were
retrieved in the two databases selected (column 'suggestedName'). The function
also returns which names were replaced or corrected (column 'tax.notes'). In
addition, the flag 'check +1 accepted' may represent an indication of possible
homonyms, i.e., different species with the same binomial, but different
authorities. Together with names there were not found in both databases, those
possible homonyms may deserve closer attention.

Note that there are still more names than those used to search for species
records. Some of these differences are due to differences in the assignment of
synonyms between speciesLink and the Brazilian Flora interface used here, the
package __flora__.

For our example, we decided to replace all edited species names (i.e.,
'scientificName.new') by the suggested species names from the function
`prepSpecies()` (i.e., 'scientificName.new'). However, __plantR__ does not
execute this step automatically and the decision to do it should be taken by the
user:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$scientificName.new <- occs$suggestedName
```

### Botanical family synonyms and standardization

The classification of the taxonomic confidence in species determination of each
occurrence is currently performed based on a global list of taxonomists per
family (see details below). Because different plant classification systems can
use different names to the same family, we need to standardize family names. The
standard used by __plantR__ to obtain valid family names is the APG IV and the
PPG I, which can be obtained using the function `prepFamily()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- prepFamily(occs)
```

Note that the function returns warnings in the case of conflicts on family names
between the original occurrences and the APG IV/PPG I family list. Some are just
differences in the list of names accepted from different classification systems,
but some may represent errors.

### The wrapper function `formatTax()`

As for the other parts of the data editing and standardization, we provide a
simple wrapper function that executes the steps above at once:

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = FALSE}
occs1 <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink,
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, drop = TRUE)
occs1 <- formatTax(occs1)
```

<br/><br/>

# Data validation

The validation steps in __plantR__ add new columns to the species data, flagging
possible problems. Depending on the study aims and spatial scale, one can use
these new columns to try to correct some of the problems or drop them from the
final data set.

## Validation of locality information: function `validateLoc()`

The editing process of locality information and its comparison against the
gazetteer return the localities (and coordinates) at the best resolution
available. In this comparison, much information provided at the locality level
is only retrieved at the municipality level, which is expected due to the
completeness of the gazetteer used (not all names of places are stored in the
standard __plantR__ gazetteer at the locality level). But many of them are only retrieved at the state/province level, meaning that fields containing state and municipality information may need to be checked.

In __plantR__ the resolution of the locality information provided with the
specimen and the one found in the gazetteer are described using the function
`validateLoc()`, which compares the two resolutions and stores the result of this comparison in a new column called 'loc.check':

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- validateLoc(occs)
unique(occs$loc.check)
```

In this column, specimens for which the locality provided could not be found in
the gazetteer at the same resolution are flagged with a "check_...". In these
cases, the locality resolution is downgraded until a locality is found in the
gazetteer. In the case that even the country is not found, then the locality is
flagged as "no_info". We also flag all the specimens that retained their
resolution (i.e., "ok_same_resolution") and those that could be retrieved at a
better locality resolution, also flagged with an "ok_" (e.g.,
'ok_state2municipality': a record which had its original resolution at the 'stateProvince' level is now at the 'municipality' level).

Note that many occurrences were flagged with a "check_...". The class
"check_local.2municip." should not be a problem, since the internal __plantR__
gazetteer does not contain a comprehensive list of names at the locality level
for the entire world. However, other "check_..." classes (e.g.,
"check_local.2country") may indicate missing information or typos that may need
some more careful inspection.


## Validation of the geographical coordinates

One important part of the validation process is to verify if the original
geographical coordinates provided with the data are valid. In __plantR__, this
validation is performed by comparing the locality information retrieved from the
gazetteer with the locality information obtained from maps based on the original
coordinates. But the validation process also flags inverted/swapped coordinates,
records falling near shorelines, borders of neighbour countries, spatial
outliers and records from cultivated individuals.

<!--  ### Load and inspect the __plantR__ default world map -->

### Validate original coordinates at country, state and county level

The first step of the validation of the geographical coordinates is to check the
original coordinates against the world (at the country level) and Latin-American
maps (at the county level). This step is performed by the function
`checkCoord()`, which returns a new column 'geo.check' containing the results:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- checkCoord(occs,
                   keep.cols = c("geo.check", "NAME_0", "country.gazet"))
unique(occs$geo.check)
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The new column 'geo.check' have some main types of classes. The first type
starts with an 'ok_' and is followed by the level at which the coordinate was
validated (e.g., country, state, county). It also contains the classes 'sea'
(i.e., coordinates falling into the sea or bays), 'bad_country' (i.e.,
coordinates falling in the land but in the wrong country), 'check_gazetteer' (i.e.,
locality not found in the gazetteer) and 'no_cannot_check' (i.e., no coordinates

not found in the gazetteer) and 'no_cannot_check' (i.e., no coordinates

available).

The function `checkCoord()` can also return the distance (in meters) between the
original coordinates from the county centroid listed in the locality information
of the record. This may help to spot coordinates that were not validated but
that are close to the reference locality.

### Coordinates falling in a neighbouring country 

Sometimes geographical coordinates can fall in another country due to rounding
or precision issues or simply because the collector was not aware that a coutry
border was crossed before obtaining the coordinates. The function
`checkBorders()` flag those cases, which is only done for the subset of records
flagged previously as 'bad_country':

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- checkBorders(occs, output = 'same.col')
unique(occs$geo.check)
```

Note that for this example, we have set the argument `output` to 'same.col'.
This means that the output of the function will be merged into the existing
column 'geo.check'. But if one wants to store this information in a separate
column, this argument can be set to 'new.col' and a new column called
'border.check' will be created.


### Coordinates in the sea but close to the shore

For those geographical coordinates flagged as falling into the sea, we can check
if they are close to the shore. Sometimes the coordinate was noted on land, but
it falls into the sea due to rounding or precision issues, or simply because
the reference map does not contain all islands or contours of the shoreline.
In __plantR__ this step is performed by the function `checkShore()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- checkShore(occs, output = 'same.col')
unique(occs$geo.check)
```

As a result, the function `checkShore()` has re-classified all records flagged
as 'sea' into 'shore' (i.e., near to the shore) and 'open_sea' (i.e., far from
the shore). By default, this verification is performed by comparing the
coordinates against a buffer of 0.5 degrees around continents and major islands
(as above). So, open sea records are those more than 0.5 degrees (~ 55 km in the
Equator) from continents and major islands. But this verification can also be
performed by calculating the distance of each coordinate to the shore and
establishing maximum distance as a limit to flag the coordinate as being close
to shore (takes much longer).

### Inverted and swapped coordinates

There are still coordinates flagged a 'bad_contry' in our dataset. Some of those
records can be due to inversions in the longitude and latitude or to the
swapping/transposing between them (i.e., latitude as longitude or vice-versa).

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- checkInverted(occs, output = 'same.col')
unique(occs$geo.check)
```

As a result, some of the records could be validated by inverting or swapping
their coordinates. These records are flagged as "ok_country" followed by the
combination of inverted and/or swapped coordinates for which validation was
acquired in brackets. Note that this function does not perform the validation
of the newly arranged coordinates at the state and county levels. So, if deemed
necessary, the user can re-include them in the function `checkCoord()`, and step
which is automatically executed by the wapper function `validateCoord()`
presented below.


### Records from cultivated individuals

Although records from cultivated individuals are not determined in __plantR__
using the geographical coordinates, cultivated individuals can sometimes be
related to records far away from the species' original distribution. Thus,
flagging these records may be important for subsetting the data for downstream
analysis. Function `getCult()` flags cultivated or possibly cultivated records
in a new column called 'cult.check':

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- getCult(occs)
table(occs$cult.check)
```

Note that the function flags two categories: 'cultivated' and 'prob_cultivated'.
The first is related to records with descriptions using terms that clearly denote
cultivated individuals (e.g., 'Cultivated', 'Planted', 'Exotic'). The second
category is related to records that contain those terms in their descriptions,
but that may need some level of double-checking by the user before they can
be safely removed as being true records from cultivated individuals.

### Spatial outliers

The last step of the validation of geographical coordinates is the search for
spatial outliers (i.e., records too far away from species core distributions),
which can indicate misidentifications or records obtained from cultivated
individuals but not declared as such. In __plantR__, the search for spatial
outliers is based on Mahalanobis distances and is executed using the function
`checkOut()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- checkOut(occs, tax.name = "scientificName.new")
```

Note that since the search for spatial outliers is performed species by species,
we need to provide the name of the column containing the species names. By
default, the function also removes invalid geographical coordinates and
records flagged as cultivated from the estimation of the center and co-variance
matrix of the geographical coordinates, which are used to get the Mahalanobis
distances.

### The wrapper function `validateCoord()`

Similar to the other steps of the __plantR__ workflow, all the steps related to 
the validation of the geographical coordinates can be performed at once, using
the function `validateCoord()`. Since this function uses information from
localities,and taxonomic information, besides the geographical coordinates
themselves, all format and validation steps related to these information should
have been carried previously.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs1 <- formatDwc(splink_data = occs_splink,
                  gbif_data = occs_gbif, drop = TRUE)
occs1 <- formatLoc(occs1)
occs1 <- formatCoord(occs1)
occs1 <- formatTax(occs1)
occs1 <- validateLoc(occs1)
occs1 <- validateCoord(occs1)
```


## Confidence level of species determinations: function `validateTax()`

One of the main features of __plantR__ is the possibility of validating species
identifications against a global list of plant taxonomists. This validation
consists of the classification of the species identification of each record into
different confidence levels and it is performed using the function
`validateTax()`:

```{r, eval = F}
occs <-  validateTax(occs)
table(occs$tax.check)/dim(occs)[1]
```

As expected, only ca. 15% of the specimens were identified by a family
specialist. Note that the function also returns a list with the names in the
TDWG format that have many identifications but are not listed as family
specialists in the __plantR__ database of plant taxonomists. Maybe this name
could represent a missing taxonomist from the database. If this is the case, one
can add one or more taxonomist names to the validation using the argument
`miss.taxonomist`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs1 <- validateTax(occs, miss.taxonomist = c("Salicaceae_Hatschbach, G."))
table(occs1$tax.check)/dim(occs)[1]
```

This is not the optimal example because Gerdt (Guenther) Hatschbach was not a
Salicaceae specialist. However, he provided determinations for many different
families outside his speciality, often referred to as a generalist. There are
some names of generalists in the __plantR__ default taxonomist database, and
those names can be included in the taxonomic validation through the arguments
`generalist`. However, this list of generalist names is biased towards South
America, particularly Brazil.

## Duplicated specimens

Another main feature of __plantR__ is the search for duplicated records across
collections (i.e. same specimen deposited in different biological collections)
and the homogenization of the information within groups of duplicated records.

### Create unique record identifiers

First we need to make sure that each records from each collection has it own
record identifier. This identifier is used to created the groups of duplicated
records. In __plantR__, we create this identifier by concatenating the
collection code (edited field 'collectionCode.new') and accession number of each
record (field 'catalogNumber') using the function `getTombo()`. And we are going
to call it 'numTombo':

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs$numTombo <- getTombo(occs[, "collectionCode.new"],
                            occs[, "catalogNumber"])
```

The function returns identifiers such as "UEC_42115" or "CEPEC_1133".

### Preparing to search for duplicates

Before searching for the duplicates, we first need to prepare the dataset for
the search. The function `prepDup()` basically creates concatenated strings with
different sets of information, which will be used in the search. Different
combinations of fields can be used to generate these search strings and they
should be provided using the argument `comb.fields`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
dups <- prepDup(occs, 
                comb.fields =   list(c("family","col.last.name","col.number","col.loc"),
     c("family","col.last.name","col.number","col.year")))
```

In this example, we used two search strings, which differ on the last information (collection locality vs. collection year). The use of two or more search strings increases the chance of finding duplicates even if one or more information is missing.

Note that we used the default arguments of the `prepDup()` function, which
exclude from the search the strings without collector name, number or year
(e.g., 's.n.' or 's.d.'), as well as missing information for these columns
(i.e., NAs). If one decided to include those strings in the search, the number
of specimens that will pass the duplicate search will increase but the chances
of finding false duplicates increase as well (e.g., Salicaceae + s.n. + s.n. +
Ubatuba or Salicaceae + s.n. + s.n. + s.d.).

### Finding duplicates across collections

Next, we can actually search for duplicated specimens using the function
`getDup()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
dups <- getDup(dups)
head(dups[order(dups$dup.ID),],6)
table(dups$dup.prop)
```
As a result, we found over 6000 records with a high chance of representing true
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
duplicates, i.e. the proportion of search strings shared between them is maximum
(dup.prop = 1). Other ~1000 specimens had only one search string in common.
Moreover, there is indication of possible ~7000 unicates, and of other ~5000
specimens we could not check for duplicates (i.e. all search strings used have
missing information).

common. Moreover, there is an indication of possible ~7000 unicates, and of
other ~5000 specimens we could not check for duplicates (i.e., all search
strings used have missing information).
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Note that if there are duplicated record identifiers (i.e., same accession
number from the same collection) both are listed within the accession number
grouped in the new column 'dup.ID'.

It is important to notice that the results of this duplicate search are only
indications. First of all, the retrieval of duplicates depends on the dataset
itself: if the collection where the duplicate was deposited is not within the
dataset (e.g., collection is not in speciesLink or GBIF), the duplicate cannot
be retrieved for obvious reasons. But other issues may change the number of
unicates and duplicates found. If the search string is too flexible (e.g. only
collector name and number), false duplicates may be retrieved if collector names
are common (e.g., 'Silva', 'Santos' or 'Lima' for Portuguese family names) and
collector numbers are low. So having more than one search string with at least 3
combinations of information decreases the chance of false duplicates. On the
other hand, we may have false unicates due to differences in the notation among
collections, which could not be solved by __plantR__ (e.g., Mattos-Silva, L.A.
vs. Silva, L.A.M.), or typos (e.g. Hoffmannsegg, J.C. vs. Hoffmannseg, J.C.).
Finally, many duplicates may still exist but due to missing information (e.g.,
collector number or collection year or locality), they can not enter the
duplicate search.

### Homogenizing the information within duplicates

Since the amount and quality of the information among collections may vary, one
may want to homogenize the information within the duplicates. This
homogenization can be carried out regarding the specimen's identification or
their locality and geographical coordinates. First, we need to combine the
results of the duplicate search with the main data frame:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- cbind.data.frame(occs, 
                         dups[,c("dup.ID", "dup.numb", "dup.prop")],
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Next, we use the function `mergeDup()` to perform the homogenization itself, which aims at expanding the best-quality information found across all specimens of each group of duplicate. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
occs <- mergeDup(occs)
table(occs$tax.check, occs$tax.check1)
```

In this example, we show that the function was able to retrieve high-confidence
species identifications for about 6000 specimens with low or unknown confidence
levels. There was also an improvement on the stats regarding the geographical
and locality checks (i.e., columns 'geo.check' vs. 'geo.check1' and 'loc.check'
vs. 'loc.check1').

Note that we used the function defaults, which created new columns for the merged information. If one wants to save the new information in the same columns, the argument `overwrite` should be set to `TRUE`.

### Removing duplicates after homogenization

__plantR__ provides a simple function for the (fast) removal of duplicates from
the data. By default, only duplicated records from the same collections are
removed from the dataset. But if the argument `rm.all` is set to TRUE, all
duplicates are removed from the data (i.e., only one record per group of
duplicate remains in the dataset). This procedure should only be performed if
the user deems it necessary and after the information among groups of duplicates
has been homogenized. All the non-homogenized information contained in the other
specimens is lost.

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
dim(occs)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
occs <- rmDup(occs)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
dim(occs)
```

### The wrapper function `validateDup()`

Similar to the other validation steps, all the steps related to duplicated
specimens can be performed at once, using the function `validateDup()`. Since
this function uses information from localities, geographical coordinates and
taxonomic information, all format and validation steps related to this
information should have been carried previously.

# Data summary and export

Finally, __plantR__ can help users to summarize their data sets and the flags of
the validation process. It also provides species checklists with user-defined
numbers of voucher specimens and the export of records by groups (e.g.,
families, countries, collections).

## Number of specimens, collections, species and other descriptors

The function `summaryData()` prepares tables containing information on the
number of records, collections, species, etc. It also provides summaries of the
top collectors and the top countries with more records:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
summ <- summaryData(occs)
```

## Summary of validation flags and other issues

__plantR__ also provides summaries of the validation process, such as the number
of duplicates found and the validation of the locality, coordinates and species
identifications. This is performed by the function `summaryFlags()`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
flags <- summaryFlags(occs)
```

## Generating checklists

Another feature of __plantR__ is the possibility of building species checklists.
This is done using the function `checkList()` which returns the family, the
total number of records and a list of vouchers (in a short or long format). The
function also returns the percentage of records with high confidence species
identification and with validated geographical coordinates.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
spp.check <- checkList(occs)
```

## Saving the occurrence data

Finally, __plantR__ provides the function `saveData()` that saves the species
records divided by any group of information, such as the species taxonomy,
collections, years and countries. By default, records will be saved as
compressed 'csv' files in the user working directory. But the user can provide
any directory using the argument `dir.name`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
saveData(occs, by = "family")
```
