Transfer code: recsou
TDWG Short name: RECSOURCE, NATOBJECT

Description: A code indication of the type of item to which the record refers.

Relevant standards: ABIS

Domain/Range/Values: Alphabetic; as defined below:

Values in 	Field	Meaning
Collection	Plant specimen
Electronic	Electronic record only, specimen no longer available
Literature	Reference
Observation	Observation, including photograph of plant, but not of specimen
Photograph	Photograph of specimen

Comments: The default should be 'Collection' for a specimen-based record. In the absence 
of any other value, a specimen-based record is assumed.

The values 'Observation' and 'Literature' may be used when the presence of a taxon is solely 
based on an observation or a published reference to an herbarium specimen held in another 
institution (respectively). The value 'Electronic' is used when the presence of a taxon is 
solely based on an electronic record of an herbarium specimen which is no longer available.
