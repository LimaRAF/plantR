Collection Date
Transfer code: cdat
TDWG Short name: COLLDATE

Description: The date on which the material was collected, as represented by this record or, if a second collection date 
		is provided (refer Second Collection Date field below), then this field contains the earlier collection date.

Relevant standards: ABIS, ITF

Domain/Range/Values: Any chronologically acceptable date, year (4 digits) followed by month (2 digits) and then day (2 digits), 
			without spaces between each.

1. In this notation, leading zeroes must be included for months and days, ie. January is coded as '01' not '1' and the 4th day is 
coded as '04' not '4'.

Example:	19851109	9 November 1985
19510203	3 February 1951

2. If the day of the month is not known, then the last two digits should be omitted.

Example: March 1901 would preferably be transferred as 190103.

3. If the day and month are not known, the last four digits should be omitted and just the 4 digit year information interchanged.

Note: The year is transferred as a full 4ï¿½digit number to facilitate the use of the system in the next century, as well as to 
track verifications from the previous century.
