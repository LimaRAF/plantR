Collector's Identifier
Transfer code: cid
TDWG Short name: COLLPREFIX, COLLNUMBER, COLLSUFFIX

Description: The sequential or other codified number given to the specimen at the time of collection, 
		by the primary collector(s), usually as on specimen label.

Relevant standards: ABIS, ITF, TLR

Domain/Range/Values: Alphanumeric.

1. The Collector's Identifier may consist of any characters in the ASCII character subset.

2. If the Primary Collector's Name is unknown, then this field would normally not be filled.

Comments:

If the Collector's Identifier is part of an institutional series, then the institution's code should be included as part of the field number.

Collector's initials should not be included as part of the field number.

If a number or component is interpreted in any way, then the interpreted part should be enclosed in brackets.

Care should be taken to avoid confusion with institutional collection series and sheet numbers. Numbers assigned to the specimen after 
collection should not be used.

If the collection number is not known, then this field should contain the value 's.n.'

The proposed TDWG specimen standards include number prefixes and suffixes. The interpretation of what constitutes these is likely to 
create more problems than it solves, so the number is treated as a single unit in HISPID3.

The ABIS standards include a former collection number in this field but this creates problems if the specimen has also been assigned 
its own field number.
